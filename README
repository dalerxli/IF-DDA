VERSION
-----------------------------------------------------------

There is two branches of the code, both are similar but one uses FFTE
(Takahashi) and is single processor, and the other one uses FFTW and
is compiled in parallel and hence, needs to have on the computer
openmp and the library fftw.

Linux installation:
-------------------------------------------------------------

The application is based on Qt-4.8 and gfortran

To install it, first you need to:

1) install the Qt packages as root:
yum install qt qt-devel

2) install gcc-c++ and gfortran as root
yum install gcc-c++ gcc-gfortran

3) at root directory
qmake-qt4
make
make install

To run the application:
cd bin
./cdm

-------------------------------------------------------------
Windows installation:
-------------------------------------------------------------
The application is based on Qt and MinGW and OpenGL

To build and install it, you need to:

1) install the Qt (5.0 or higher) with OpenGl and MinGW options including the QtCreator IDE

2) Open cmd_install.pro file in the root directory with QtCreator.exe

3) Build full project. You can run the executable cdm.exe directly from QtCreator.

4) To run the application in stand-alone, you need to deploy it along with a few runtime libraries.
For example if you built with Qt 5.3 (OpenGL included) and MinGW-4.8.2 option, 
the list of dll (in the Qt and MinGW-4.8.2 lib subdirectories) 
that have to be present in the same directory as cdm.exe:
icudt52.dll
icuin52.dll
icuuc52.dll
libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
libgfortran-3.dll
libquadmath-0.dll
libstdc++-6.dll
libwinpthread-1.dll
Qt5Core.dll
Qt5Gui.dll
Qt5OpenGL.dll
Qt5PrintSupport.dll
Qt5Sql.dll
Qt5Svg.dll
Qt5Widgets.dll
